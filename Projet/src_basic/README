Rules : You are the red planet and you want to capture all the blue planets ( controlled by an AI ).

To complete your mission you can : click on your planet to select it,
scroll the number of ships that you want to send, ( not in percentage ) 
Then, you can select the planet where you want to send your squadron by releasing your mouse inside it.
When the squadron is moving you can select a ship ( a red square will appear ) and his squadron ( a yellow square for the rest of the squadron). 
You can deselect your ship by clicking on it. 
Then, by clicking on a planet you can switch their planet target. 
All the ships that still moving will change their target, but if the red square go inside a planet, the whole squadron will be not selected anymore.

You will have four button on the menu ( represnted by circles ), the first one to play the game, 
the second to save your game, the third to leave and the last to load a save. 
Three button will be in the down left corner when you are playing. 
The first one to pause the game and return to the menu.
The second to save and return to the menu.
The third to leave the game. 
It would have been more fitting to use button in place of circle.

Good luck and don't let the AI beat you. It have no time to wait for you!

Some ships can't move because of our way to avoid a planet. They stay into an infinite loop
When one of them is blocked, sometimes, the save/load don't display a planet. 
If your planet select is capture, you can still launch ships from this planet , but the ship will not be yours. 
To solve this, we just need to check when the ship are send if the planet is still yours.
